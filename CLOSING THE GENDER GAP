<p class="pxl-padding-bottom-md">The Second Wave of COVID-29 in Nepal started in mid-April and the daily infection rate has intensely increased to almost 10000 people per day from 300 people per day within a month. 
The economic turmoil fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic and stay-at-home policies has disrupted various occupations and industries, many of them female-dominated.

In 2021, women make $0.82 for every dollar a man makes which is one cent more than they made in 2020.

<h3 class="pxl-header-md section-subtitle">Why are women paid less than men?</h3>
<h3 class="pxl-header-md pxl-margin-bottom-lg section-subtitle">Why is the uncontrolled pay gap so much larger?</h3>
<p class="pxl-margin-bottom-md">The uncontrolled pay gap is an indicator of how gendered wealth and power is within a society and is driven by many forces. Occupational segregation is one large driver of the overall pay differences between men and women. For example, education and healthcare support are female-dominated occupational groups while architecture &#038; engineering is a male-dominated occupational group. Education occupations have much lower median pay than engineering occupations, which helps explain the large differences we see in average pay for men and women when data are uncontrolled</p>
<p class="pxl-margin-bottom-md">Men and women choosing different careers doesn&#8217;t mean that the uncontrolled pay gap is less significant than the controlled pay gap. The uncontrolled pay gap reveals the overall economic power disparity between men and women in society. Even if the controlled pay gap disappeared &#8211; meaning women and men with the same qualifications were paid equally &#8211; the uncontrolled pay gap could persist if high paying positions were disproportionately accessible to men.</p>

<p class="pxl-margin-bottom-md">TWeâ€™ve now spent a full year under pandemic conditions in an industry marked by upheaval. We find ourselves at a crossroads, where progress toward gender equality is threatened by a crisis that disproportionately impacts women
</p>
<p class="pxl-margin-bottom-md">The fight for gender equality continues to be crucial, especially with this setback.
The third annual TrustRadius Women in Tech Report offers insight into these issues.
We surveyed over 450 tech professionals (66% who identified as women). In their words, we discovered the biggest challenges women in tech face in 2021. We also heard their suggestions for what can be done to fix them.

<p class="pxl-margin-bottom-md pxl-text-reversed"> We need more women in computing and data science to bring thier skills and perspectives to the table for better performance overall.However, closing the gende gap in technology shouldn't only be ablout reaching varetain ratio of women to men within the field.</p>
<p class="pxl-margin-bottom-md pxl-text-reversed"> Women remain the kinority in technology and datta science,but its not necessarily a push to bring more in, Rather, its a movement to bring awareness to the current situation,highlight the growth opportunities availabel,and bring the benefits of gender diversity to light.</p>
