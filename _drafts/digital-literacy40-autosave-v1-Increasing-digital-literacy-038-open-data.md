**U**Code for Nepal has identified the importance of open data and since its establishments the organization has been proactively providing data on its website related to various sectors like education, women empowerment and so on. Code for Nepal has been successfully able to synthesize the open data and reach the masses with important and critical information worldwide.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Code for Nepal conducted a pilot research and data collection project in the first half of 2015 to assess the presence of women in Nepal’s online media. The data collection and infographic published by Code for Nepal, was well received by </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nepali Times</span>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_Times) <span style="font-weight: 400;">and Setopati. Code for Nepal also received a media mention for the data mining by Nepali Times on </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Twitter</span>](https://twitter.com/nepalitimes/status/632903423441047557)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The organization also partners with other media houses and journalists in Nepal to formulate databases stories. Report prepared by Center for Public Expenditure and Openspending.org was analyzed to publish an infographic on </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">“How much does it cost to run Kathmandu?”</span>](https://codefornepal.org/2015/08/how-much-does-it-cost-to-run-kathmandu/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">by Code for Nepal. Similarly, key data about </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">status of women</span>](https://codefornepal.org/2015/03/status-of-women-in-nepal-in-5-charts/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">based on a report by World Bank was also published by Code for Nepal on International Women’s day in 2015.</span>  
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, Code for Nepal has also published important data about </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Women Prisoners</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in Nepal </span>](https://codefornepal.org/2015/02/numbers-of-female-prisoners-increased-by-239-in-nepal/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">and has shed light on the issue. By sharing the embed code to the interested parties, Code for Nepal promotes the use of open data and sharing quality information on the web.</span>
