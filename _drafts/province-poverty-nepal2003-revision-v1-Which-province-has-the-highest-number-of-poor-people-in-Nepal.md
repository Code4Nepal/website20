<span style="font-weight: 400;">There are seven newly formed provinces in Nepal. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Among them, Province 2 has the highest number of multidimensionally poor Nepalis. More than 2.5 million (25 Lakhs) people who are multidimensionally poor live in Province 2. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">That makes Province 2 home to the highest number of multidimensionally poor people of any province in the country. Province 2 has 35% of all poor Nepalis according to </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)</span>](http://npc.gov.np/images/category/Nepal_MPI.pdf) <span style="font-weight: 400;">released by the Nepal Government. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike traditional poverty rates which looks at the monetary indicator, </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Multidimensional Poverty Index</span>](http://npc.gov.np/images/category/Nepal_MPI.pdf) <span style="font-weight: 400;">looks at ten indicators in Nepal. Those indicators are </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">child mortality, years of schooling, school attendance, nutrition, cooking fuel, improved sanitation, improved drinking water, electricity, asset ownership and flooring and roofing. If a Nepali is deprived in at least three of these indicators, then she/he is considered poor. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nepal’s Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">28.6% of Nepal’s population is multidimensionally poor. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the report: “Provinces 6 and 2 have the highest rate of multidimensional poverty – with every second person being multidimensionally poor (50%) – followed by Provinces 5 and 7 (approximately 30%).” </span>

Look at this chart to see which province has what share of multidimensionally poor. 



<span style="font-weight: 400;">Province 2 is the second largest province in the country. Province 2 located in southeastern part of Nepal includes Bara, Dhanusha, Mahottari, Parsa, Rauthat, Saptari, Sarlahi and Siraha.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Province 6 is the smallest province in Nepal and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> includes these districts: Dailekh, Dolpa, Humla, Jajarkot, Jumla, Kalikot Mugu, Rukum (western part) Salyan, Surkhet. </span>
