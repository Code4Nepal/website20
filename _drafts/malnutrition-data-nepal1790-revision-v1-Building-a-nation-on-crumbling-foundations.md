<span style="font-weight: 400;">Children are considered to be the foundation that the future of a nation rests upon.  Only a proper investment in today’s children will bring us a better tomorrow. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">But a quick glance at child nourishment data shows by nepalmap.org shows that </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">40 %</span>](http://www.nepalmap.org/profiles/country-NP-nepal/#child-health) <span style="font-weight: 400;">children under the age of five in Nepal are malnourished. Under such scenario, almost half of the children in Nepal do not get a well-balanced meal, which is bound to hamper nation’s development.</span>  
[<img class=" wp-image-72 aligncenter" src="https://codefornepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/code_for_nepal_students_2-e1418614920650.jpg" alt="" width="787" height="403" />](https://codefornepal.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/code_for_nepal_students_2-e1418614920650.jpg)

The six districts namely Humla, Bajhang, Baitadi, Surkhet, Doti, Achham, Okhaldhunga, Terhathum, Panchthar have a staggeringly high percentage of child malnourishment rate, all above 56 percent, with Humla being the district with the highest number of <span style="font-weight: 400;">children malnourished. Only 4 out of 10 children in Humla get proper nourishment which is an alarming statistics.</span>

[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Humla</span>](http://www.nepalmap.org/profiles/district-56-humla/#child-health)<span style="font-weight: 400;">: 65.7</span>

Tehrahathum : <span style="font-weight: 400;">63.4</span>

[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bajhang</span>](http://www.nepalmap.org/profiles/district-56-humla/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">: 63.2</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Achham and Baitadi : 59.2</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Surkhet : 57.9</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ordering districts according to lowest percentage of children malnourished</span>

[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lalitpur</span>](http://www.nepalmap.org/profiles/district-26-lalitpur/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">: 16.2 </span>

[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kavrepalanchowk</span>](http://www.nepalmap.org/profiles/district-24-kavrepalanchok/#child-health) <span style="font-weight: 400;">: 21.7</span>

[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kaski </span>](http://www.nepalmap.org/profiles/district-40-kaski/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">: 22.9</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jhapa : 24. 2 </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Makwanpur : 25.1</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">      Possible reasons for such distribution could be poverty, lack of fertile land for cultivation: geography, climate being possible causes, unavailability of roads and other means of transport, lack of proper awareness and education, diseases accompanied during childbirth. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">   To reduce the number of malnourished children, the following could be few suggestions:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">1.Excellent transportation facility throughout the nation for the distribution of local, nutritious products in cheaper rates.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Education and dissemination of information on nutrition. The government should also train local farmers on efficient agricultural practices such as crop rotation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">3.Allocation of funding to child nutrition programs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">4.Expand reach through community health workers</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">5.Research and development to increase crop yields.</span>
