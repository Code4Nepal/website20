<span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, every family is unique but thanks to the Annual Household Survey published by Nepal Government, we know how an average Nepali family spend their money. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The average annual household consumption of Nepal in 2015/16 was Rs, 3,22, 730 or approximately USD 3111.12. (Exchange rate: 1 Nepalese Rupee equals 0.0096 US Dollar)</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">More than half of it or 53.8% was spent on food. 12.9% was spent on rent. Unfortunately, a typical Nepali family spends almost the same amount on education (4%), and alcohol and tobacco (3.9%). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Explore the chart below to see how Nepalis spend their money. </span>



<span style="font-weight: 400;">Compared to 2014/15, the average household consumption has increased by Rs 30,418</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Inequality in Nepal is widening. &#8220;</span>_<span style="font-weight: 400;">the annual consumption of the richest 20% households is Rs. 6,13,725 which is 4.2 times higher than that of the poorest 20% households.&#8221;Â </span>_
