  Code for Nepal works to increase digital literacy and the use of open data in Nepal. We give scholarships to young women and men, especially from underprivileged &nbsp;background. We organize conferences where we ensure 50% of our speakers are women. <br />
</p>

Women make majority of Nepalâ€™s population. Traditionally they have been marginalized. They have lacked access to education, jobs or any kind of opportunities. In recent decades, many have gained education. Some have jobs. While reliable data is not available, gender digital divide is huge in Nepal.  


Code for Nepal is a volunteer-led non-profit. 100% of your donations will be used for our projects to digitally empower women. Please make <g class="gr_ gr\_5 gr-alert gr\_spell gr\_inline\_cards gr\_run\_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="5" data-gr-id="5">tax deductible</g> donations.

Watch Yogina Shakya, a Code for Nepal fellow had to say about our digital empowerment program that she participated in.
