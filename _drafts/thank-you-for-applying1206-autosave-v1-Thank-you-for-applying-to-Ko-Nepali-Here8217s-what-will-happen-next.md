Thank you for applying to &#8220;Ko Nepali.&#8221; On this page, you will find information on what to expect next and meet judges of this competition. (Also follow us on Code for Nepal <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.twitter.com/codefornepal" target="_blank">Twitter</a></span> and <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.facebook.com/codefornepal" target="_blank">Facebook page</a></span> to keep up with latest updates!)

### **So what happens next? **

  * _Once submissions close on April 27, 2016, the Code for Nepal team will review each to ensure these are original, vulgar-free, and not against any person or community. Entries that meet Code for Nepal’s criteria will be shared on <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.facebook.com/codefornepal" target="_blank">Code for Nepal’s Facebook page</a></span>. By submitting your entry, you agree to have Code for Nepal share your work on social media._ 
  * _In early May, participants and audiences will then be encouraged to share their favorite entries via <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="http://www.facebook.com/codefornepal" target="_blank">Code for Nepal&#8217;s Facebook page</a></span>. In early June, the top 20 videos and 20 photos with the highest number of shares via Code for Nepal&#8217;s Facebook page will be sent to judges for final review. If submissions by women and people outside of Kathmandu Valley are not represented at 30% among the top entries (i.e. at least 6 videos and 6 photos), Code for Nepal will include the most shared entries from women and from those in areas outside of Kathmandu Valley._ 
  * __The judges will grade each video from 1 to 20 — 1 being the lowest grade, 20 being the highest grade.  The 5 videos and 5 photos that receive the highest grade on average from judges will win cash prizes. The results will be announced by Code for Nepal via its Facebook page in late June.__
