Happy International Women&#8217;s Day! First let us tell you that there is a good news for Nepal. For the first time, the number of girls sitting for <a href="http://nepalitimes.com/article/editorial/everyday-should-be-international-women-day,2063" target="_blank">SLC examinations</a> has overtaken the number of boys.

Recently, Nepal has made progress in electing more women to parliaments more so than its South Asian neighbors. In 2006, only 5.6% of seats in parliaments were held by women. In 2008, it reaches the highest: 33.8%. Wasn&#8217;t that a great news? But in 2014, it fell to 29.9%. Let&#8217;s hope there will be an increase in the near future.

Even though the female literacy rate in Nepal has increased significantly in the last 40 years. In the early 1980s, it was just about 10%. Now, it&#8217;s more than 50%. But it hasn&#8217;t made enough progress when it comes to ensuring there are more women in the labor force. In 2000, ratio of female to male of proportion of a country’s working-age population (ages 15 and older) was 0.76. Now, it&#8217;s 0.86%. It&#8217;s still good compared to its other South Asian neighbors.
