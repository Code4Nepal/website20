  1. Computers are the uncontested source of knowledge.
  2. Computers are gateway to information and the potential to learn through them are vast. Having a computer can expand the resources available to the school as well as facilitate the much-needed computer literacy.
  3. It is our right, sanctioned by the constitution. The constitution of Nepal promulgated in 2015 states that the public should be able to easily access information. The policy also adds that this ease of access to information should be ensured through expansion of information technology as it is in necessary for accelerating the nation’s development. Having computer literacy at school level is aligned with this policy and imparts computer literacy among the Nepali population.
  4. Keeping up with the changing world. With the current expansion of information technology and its reach, it is only fair that computer literacy is prioritized. Countries around the world have incorporated computer classes in the core curriculum of schools and when every academic field has an extension rooted in computer technology, it is only logical to attain computer literacy to keep up with the changing world.
  5. Skill development. Computer literacy is a very crucial skill to have in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. If computer literacy is incorporated in school curriculum, it allows students to attain computer skills which they can utilize for academic, employment or even developmental opportunities.
  6. Increased employment opportunity. As mentioned earlier, knowledge of computer skills or proficiency in computer literacy allows a person to pursue more job opportunities.
  7. Earlier the better. The earlier the students are introduced to computers, the easier it will be for them to grasp the concepts and be able to pursue it.

Having computers is a win-win situation for all. However, the current state of computer literacy in Nepal is still in its nascent stage. Many schools across the nation are still struggling to afford a computer, let alone offer articulate courses. Following info-graphs gives us a glimpse of the current status of computer literacy in Nepal.

On the brighter side, implementation of Information-Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructures in school education have been recognized by the policymakers.

Initiatives like one Laptop per Child (OLPC), Lab Model (computer sharing mechanism) and internet access to schools have started to get implemented. There is still a lot to be done and it takes a combined contribution and support from both private and public sector to change that.

Spread the word!
