On Open Data day in 2014, eager civic hackers, development experts [gathered at the World Bank](http://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/open-data-community-grows-together-stays-together) auditorium for one purpose: to use data for public good.

It was Code for Nepal’s first hackathon. Code for Nepal wasn’t officially launched yet though. Code for Nepal was at the [hackathon to work with the DC open data community](https://opendatadaydc.hackpad.com/Practical-Open-Data-for-Nepal-Data-Driven-Stories-Visualizations-Q3c2in2rAKK) to come up with products that people can use on everyday life.

We had about 8 hours to build something. Code for Nepal co-founder Ravi Kumar, suggested that we look at [schools performance data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmLBbdDz0V5DdHA5a2Nlelh0dGd4N2xkV1ltcEhVUGc&usp=sharing) in Nepal, analyze it, and built a prototype of an app to rank schools based on the performance.

The inspiration for this app came from Ravi’s own experience as a child when his parents moved from village to town and searched for schools for him and his siblings. Today thousands of Nepalis are migrating from villages to towns and cities in Nepal.

When families move to town, one of their first priorities is to find good schools for their kids. As throughout the world, mouth of word remains a powerful medium for schools to promote themselves. We thought there might be another way to help people determine a good school based on the available data out there.

Michael Branan, and Jacob Menajovsky, Seth James, and Ravi Kumar, worked for approximately 6 hours, to build this prototype. Below you will find the first version of the app.

We hope to update it, fix bugs and market it so people can use it for free. Please explore the map below and leave comment below if you think we should make changes.

How we ranked the schools:
