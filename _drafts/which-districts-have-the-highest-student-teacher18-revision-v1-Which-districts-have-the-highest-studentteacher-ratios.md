For the purpose of understanding this map, student–teacher ratio is the number of students who attend schools in a district divided by the number of teachers in that district.

For example, If student-teacher ratio is 100, that means there are 100 students per teacher. Now think about it: You are a 5th grade student in a village in Nepal. There are 100 students in your class and just one teacher. Wouldn’t it be hard for you to learn anything?

The higher the student-teacher ratio, the harder it is for students to learn and get attention of teachers.

Rautahat has the highest student teacher ratio in Nepal followed by Sarlahi and Mahottari.

Explore the map to find out student-teacher ratio in different districts.
