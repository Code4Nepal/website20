On June 16,Â The Office of the Controller of Examinations published the results of the School Leaving Certificate exams-2016.

We looked at **Nepal Census data 2011, the latest census, to create a map of number of SLC holders in each districts of Nepal**.

Of course, the districts with more population have higher number of people with SLC compared to districts with less population.

Check out the map below to see how many people in your district have SLC! Comment below if you are surprised!
