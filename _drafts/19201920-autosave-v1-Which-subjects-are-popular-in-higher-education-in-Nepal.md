<p style="text-align: left;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">The demographics data from </span><a href="http://www.nepalmap.org/profiles/country-NP-nepal/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nepalmap.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows that </span><a href="http://www.nepalmap.org/profiles/country-NP-nepal/#literacy-by-sex"><span style="font-weight: 400;">66%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Nepalese can read and write. However, only </span><a href="http://www.nepalmap.org/profiles/country-NP-nepal/#education-level-reached"><span style="font-weight: 400;">39%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of Nepalese have passed the primary level. To further break it down, only 10% have passed SLC, 6% have passed intermediate, 3% have graduated and only 1% have acquired a postgraduate degree. </span>
</p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This means only 1 out of 100 Nepali has a Master’s degree and only  3 in 100 have a bachelor&#8217;s degree. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">data </span>](http://nepalmap.org/profiles/country-NP-nepal/#field-of-study)<span style="font-weight: 400;">on the study major for higher education reveals that business as a study of the subject is the most popular for higher studies. </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">25%</span>](http://nepalmap.org/profiles/country-NP-nepal/#field-of-study) <span style="font-weight: 400;">of those who pursue higher education in Nepal study business. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engineering, Law, Mathematics, Journalism, Agriculture and computing has the least numbers of students enrolled in. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the data distribution shows a wide discrepancy in the male to female ratio within the classes such as mathematics and statistics, law, engineering manufacturing and construction, computing, agriculture forestry and fishery. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In these fields, the ratio is such that for every two males in the classroom there exists only a single female attending the same class. This discrepancy can be ascribed to several reasons. Fewer number of female enrolled in higher education, already existing disproportionate male-to-female ratio in higher educational status, social bias towards the education of female and prevalence of stereotypical mindset on fields of study that are “suitable” for females could be few of possible reasons.</span>
