<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, about 50%</span>[ <span style="font-weight: 400;">of Nepalis</span>](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.STA.ACSN?locations=NP) <span style="font-weight: 400;">had access to toilets or improved sanitation. In the same year, about </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">100% of Nepalis</span>](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.CEL.SETS.P2?locations=NP) <span style="font-weight: 400;">had mobile cellular subscriptions. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Both mobiles and toilets are important. But historical data shows that Nepal needs to do more to increase access to toilets or improved sanitation. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2005, almost 30 percent or </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">almost one in three Nepalis had access to toilets</span>](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.STA.ACSN?locations=NP)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2005, less than 1 percent of people in Nepal had access to mobile phones. Since then as we know mobile subscriptions have skyrocketed. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, that’s not the case with toilets.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at these charts below. </span>
