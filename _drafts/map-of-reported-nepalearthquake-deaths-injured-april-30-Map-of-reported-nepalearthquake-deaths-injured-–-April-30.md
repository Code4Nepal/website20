Officials said the death toll from the <a class="_58cn" href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/nepalearthquake?source=feed_text&story_id=10155550591670002" data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;*N&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:104}"><span class="_58cl">‪#‎</span><span class="_58cm">NepalEarthquake‬</span></a> passed 5,000 – and could reach as many as 10,000.

In a hope to help deliver aid in all affected areas and provide a bigger picture, we created this map. The districts where there are many deaths (red areas in the map below) also mean that in those districts there are likely many people who are injured and need immediate relief.



The map is based on <a href="http://neoc.gov.np/en/2072.1.17-0800-92.html" target="_blank">April 30 data (pdf in Nepali language)</a>from Ministry of Home Affairs.  We hope to update it soon.
