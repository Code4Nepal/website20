When a country is struggling on a daily basis to meet its basic needs, it&#8217;s hard to believe that over the last few decades, Nepal has made progress. Here are four charts that show how Nepal has made progress! Check it and share with others!

**In 1960, the life expectancy of an average Nepal was just a little more than 35 years! In 2014, it&#8217;s almost 70 years! Life expectancy has doubled in the last fifty-four years in Nepal! **



**In 2005, only just about 1 in 100 Nepali had a subscription to cellular mobile. In 2014, less than a decade later, more than 80 in 100 Nepalis has a subscription to cellular mobile. **
