&#8220;My name is Susan Sunuwar. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor degree in CSIT, 7th semester running. I always had interest in Web Development, so I decided to apply for the scholarship as soon as I saw the notice on facebook. I hope to improve my current knowledge and skill in programming.&#8221;

Congratulations Susan!  
We are looking forward to introduce the four other recipients of the scholarship over the next few weeks!
